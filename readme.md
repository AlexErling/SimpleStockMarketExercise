### **Super Simple Stock Market** 

**Requirements**
___
    1. The Global Beverage Corporation Exchange is a new stock market trading in drinks companies.
        a. Your company is building the object-oriented system to run that trading.
        b. You have been assigned to build part of the core object model for a limited phase 1
    2. Provide the complete source code that will:-
        a. For a given stock,
            i. Given any price as input, calculate the dividend yield
            ii. Given any price as input, calculate the P/E Ratio
            iii. Record a trade, with timestamp, quantity, buy or sell indicator and price
            iv. Calculate Volume Weighted Stock Price based on trades in past 5 minutes
        b. Calculate the GBCE All



**Notes:**

    This is my solution for the Simple Stock Market Project. Added an API built with FastAPI and a Uvicorn server to be able to interact
    with the stock market. Given the time constraints and the scope, the stocks are input using a CSV File. Also, cause we aren't
    initializing with previous stock information, trades will need to be entered to properly calculate VWAP for stocks (since pricing data is required)
    Given the time constraint, I am making an assumption that any data received would already be sanitized. In a real production
    environment, I would add more input validations.
    
    Potential Future Enhancements:
    * Updating pricing information with background workers (Celery)
    * Improved Testing, especiallly for the API, didn't add API testing as not in scope
    * Creating a logging micro service
    * Adding imprvoed I/O - Storing the trade history in a database 
    * Adding more input validation
    * Adding success and response codes
    * Adding more class methods
    * Improved API Functionality (Add/Remove Stock, Update Stock Information, Get Stock Data)
    

**How to Setup:**
____
    Download packge
    Set up a virtual environment if you prefer:
    https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/
    
    Download requirements with pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    Run Server: uvicorn main:app

    

**Testing:**
____
    Due to size of project, I decided to keep tests in one file. I would break out and have more testing in an actual project
    python3 -m unittest SuperSimpleStockTests

**API Endpoints:**
___
    GET /index/
    
    Ex: http://127.0.0.1:8000/index
    Params = NONE
    Returns GBCE ALL Share Index (float) using the geometric mean of the Volume Weighted Stock Price for all stocks
    Will return NAN if no trade back from some stocks 
    
    
    GET /stocks/per/

    Ex: http://127.0.0.1:8000/stocks/per/?ticker=TEA&price=70.5
    Params = ticker, price 
    Returns P.E Ratio for specified ticker. Returns NAN if not available


    GET /stocks/vwap/

    Ex: http://127.0.0.1:8000/stocks/vwap/?ticker=TEA
    Params = ticker 
    Returns Volume Weighted Stock Price for specified ticker. Returns NAN if not available
    
    
    GET /stocks/divyield/

    Ex: http://127.0.0.1:8000/stocks/divyield/?ticker=TEA&price=70.5
    Params = ticker, price 
    Returns P.E Ratio for specified stock. Returns NAN if not available


    POST /trade
    
    Ex. http://127.0.0.1:8000/trade/?ticker=JOE&order_type=sell&quantity=100&price=500
    PARAMS = ticker, order_type (buy/sell), quantity, price
    Returns a trade successful response. Will return error if invalid ticker.

**Main Classes:**

    - StockMarket
    - Stocks
    - StockEnum
    - Stock
    - Stock Pricing - Made design decision to separate out the pricing information into own class 
    - StockFactory
    - CommonStock
    - PreferredStock
    - Trade
    - TradeHistory - Did not expand as out of the scope of this assignment - would want to store the history in 
    a separate database
